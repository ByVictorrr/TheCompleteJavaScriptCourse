/*CODING CHALLENGE 2
	/*
	 * John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.
	 * 1. Calculate the average score for each team
	 * 2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.
	 * 3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)
	 * 4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem :)
	 * 5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.
	 * GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
